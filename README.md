# Telic Ambiguity Environment

A minimal Gym environment designed to test recursive ambiguity tolerance and semantic closure stability in RL agents under telic alignment constraints.

## Files

- `telic_ambiguity_env.py`: Custom environment definition
- `random_agent_demo.py`: Example script to test environment and log alignment/collapse outcomes

## Goal

Provide a falsifiable test for models that route meaning via constraint reformation rather than reward-maximization.  
See discussion with @grok for technical context and simulation results.
